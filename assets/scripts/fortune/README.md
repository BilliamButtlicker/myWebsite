# This project is a random message generator.

## It creates a random message from 3 strings.

### The first string is a statement. The second two strings are randomly chosen from arrays of good and bad messages.
### The second message is conjugated based on whether it and the first message are both good, both bad, or one of each.

#### The code currently logs the full message to the console. To return the message instead, simply call generateMessage().
