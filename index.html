                <p>I've been learning to code for <span id="time-coding">year</span>, but have had some minor experience before that at my previous 
                job. Unfortunately, I didn't get very far due to other responsibilities taking priority, but I quickly realised I enjoyed whatever time I 
                was able to spend coding (even though there were lots of errors to begin with!)</p>

                <p>From my first pokemon game as a young child, to modern visual masterpieces like God of War and The Witcher 3,
                    I've always had a passion for video games. But as much as I love exploring these alternate realities, without 
                    exception, I have always thought at least once:
                </p>
                <h3>My games!</h3>
                <p>Here is a list of the 'games' I've developed myself! They're rather simple (non-existent) for now, but I will be adding more 
                    complex games in the future!
